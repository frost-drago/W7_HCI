/*JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
**ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
**ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6.
**Since 2016 new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016 / 2017 / 2018). */

//Making variables with let:
//https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_let.asp
//Since ES6, two new ways to define variables that are let and const, besides using var
let numberOfFriends = 1;

//Incrementing:
numberOfFriends += 3; //numberOfFriends is now 4

// Variables with const
const minimumAge = 21; //CANNOT REASSIGN!

//Booleans - true or false values
true;
false;
let isHappy = true;

//Naming Conventions
// Use upper camel-cased names:
let numberOfChickens = 6; //GOOD
// NOT THE JS WAY:
// let number_of_chickens = 6;
