I'm sorry. I've been overwhelmed lately. The midterms is coming soon. I haven't been able to do the freecodecamp thing. I'm planning to not continue on that and just deal with my HCI final project.

## JavaJam

Here's my JavaJam website with Bootstrap.

I don't know how you're doing but wishing you all the best. Hopefully you'll find that balance since you're juggling between your TA duties and your own lessons.

## Personal profile

I tried to add some bootstrap elements into the website, but it generally stays the same. The **[working on]** page is updated though. I don't think I can spend more hours on this.

## HCI JS Demo (template from @Rlirri)

`_rd` on the end of the file signifies I've read it. Answered questions. Added some comments for personal example. Maps, Arrow Functions, Filter combo seems complex but useful. I need to get used to the syntax though. The hardest one to follow is **Reduce**.

[RLirri&#39;s JS Demo](https://github.com/RLirri/HCI_JS_Demo "Github link")

Notes:

* Added `conditionals.html` for `conditionals.js` in `HCI_JS_Demo-main\.`
* Added `greeting.html` for `greeting.js` in `HCI_JS_Demo-main\`. `greeting.js` can now be accessed through both `JS demo 1.html` or `greeting.html`.

* `external condition.js` (requirement for `JS demo2.html`) does not exist.
