I'm sorry. I've been overwhelmed lately. The midterms is coming soon. I haven't been able to do the freecodecamp thing. I'm planning to not continue on that and just deal with my HCI final project.

Here's my JavaJam website with Bootstrap. 

I don't know how you're doing but wishing you all the best. Hopefully you'll find that balance since you're juggling between your TA duties and your own lessons.
